# Task 5: Decision Trees and Random Forests

## 📌 Objective
This task focuses on learning tree-based models for classification using the Heart Disease dataset.

## 📁 Files Included
- `Task5.py`: Python program for training and evaluating Decision Tree and Random Forest classifiers.
- `heart.csv`: Dataset used for model training and testing.
- `decision_tree.png`: Visualization of a simplified Decision Tree.
- `feature_importance.png`: Feature importance chart from Random Forest.

## 🔧 Tools & Libraries Used
- Python
- pandas, numpy
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

## 🧠 Concepts Covered
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Controlling tree depth to avoid overfitting
- Random Forest Classifier
- Feature importance
- Model evaluation using accuracy and classification report
- Cross-validation

## 🏃‍♂️ How to Run
1. Place all files inside:
   ```
   C://Users//KIIT//OneDrive//Desktop//ELAB//Task-5//
   ```
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Run the Python file:
   ```
   python Task5.py
   ```

## ✅ Output
- Accuracy scores and reports for both classifiers.
- Plots saved as:
  - `decision_tree.png`
  - `feature_importance.png`
  - `heart_processed.csv`
  - `task5.py`
